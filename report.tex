An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a voltage versus time graph of the heart’s electrical activity. Important information is contained in
the frequency spectrum of an ECG that may be used in the diagnosis of heart conditions. Proper diagnosis is dependent on the observed 
ECG being free of noise. Digital filtering techniques are commonly employed to remove additive noise from an ECG.\\

\noindent In this assignment, an ECG signal corrupted by additive noise at two frequencies was provided. The noise frequencies were
identified by observing the ECG spectrum. Finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) notch filtering techniques
for removing the noise were investigated. Three FIR filtering design methods were compared – windowing, optimal, and frequency-sampled.
The IIR filter was designed with pole-zero placement.\\ 

\noindent Filter performance was evaluated based on the notch attenuation, transition bandwidths, phase response, and computational
complexity. It was determined the IIR filter gave the best performance of the four filters. The window and optimal FIR filters were
implemented using the Python SciPy library. The frequency-sampled filter was designed with custom code and the IIR filter was designed
analytically.

\section{Introduction}
This report describes the detection of additive noise on a digital electrocardiogram (ECG) and the design and implementation of digital
notch filters to remove this noise. An ECG is a voltage versus time signal of the heart’s electrical activity. Real-world ECGs may be
subject to additive noise. Notch filters are used to remove narrowband interference from ECGs, such as 50 Hz noise from the mains power
system.\\

\noindent An ECG signal provided for this assignment contains 50,000 samples taken at a sampling rate of 1024 Hz. It is corrupted by additive noise
at 32.6 Hz and 61.7 Hz; the noise frequencies were identified by plotting the signals magnitude spectrum. To remove the noise, three FIR
filters and an IIR filter were designed and implemented in Python. The filters can each be considered cascaded notch filters with stopbands
centred at the noise frequencies. The FIR filters were implemented with the window, optimal, and frequency sampling methods. The IIR filter
was implemented by cascading two dual-pole, dual-zero placed notch filters.\\

\noindent Each filter’s operation was verified by plotting the spectrum of the filtered ECG signals. The mean noise power was estimated by computing
the variance of the noise signal. This report compares the filter’s magnitude response, phase response, and computational efficiency.\\

\noindent The next section of this report describes the methods used to design each filter. Results are presented in Section 3. In Section 4 the
performance of the filters is discussed. The report is concluded in Section 5. References are found in Section 6.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Noise Identification}
The noise frequencies were identified by calculating the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the noisy ECG signal. The SciPy function \texttt{fft}
was used for this. The noise frequencies are characterised by impulses in the signal spectrum at 32.6 Hz and 61.7 Hz. Plots of the ECG signal
and its spectrum are found in Section 3.1.

\subsection{Window FIR Filter}
The window method designs an FIR filter by truncating or tapering the ideal filter response; this is to multiply it by a window function [1].
This filter was implemented using SciPy’s \texttt{firwin} function, which is described in Fig. 1. The specifications were to limit the number of FIR
coefficients to 400. Note that \texttt{firwin} designs a linear phase filter. It is not possible to design a linear phase FIR band-stop filter with
an even number of coefficients, as type II and type IV FIR filters have zeros at the Nyquist frequency and zero frequency, respectively.
Therefore, \texttt{numtaps} passed to \texttt{firwin} was 399. Using as many coefficients as possible was desirable as computational power was abundant for
this simulation. The sampling frequency was passed as 1024 Hz by the parameter \texttt{fs}.\\

\noindent To design a band-stop filter, the parameter \texttt{cutoff} should be an array which defines the filter cut-off frequencies. The default
\texttt{pass\_zero} value of \textit{True} means a band-stop filter is designed. A narrower stopband results in less stop-band attenuation. By experimentation,
it was found the noise frequencies were not present in the filtered output (i.e. sufficiently attenuated) for stop-bandwidths of 8 Hz. Therefore,
\texttt{cutoff} passed to \texttt{firwin} was $[28.6, 36.6, 57.7, 65.7]$. The window used was a Hamming window; a discussion on the effect of window types is found in Section 4.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{firwin.png}
    \caption{Function prototype and description for \texttt{firwin}.}
    \label{fig:firwin}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Optimal FIR Filter}
Digital filters designed via the window method have the largest ripples at the passband and stopband edges. The optimal method of FIR filter design aims to keep the ripple
constant in the passbands and stopbands. FIR filter coefficients are calculated by this method with the SciPy function remez, which is described in Fig. 2. For the same
reason described in Section 2.1, \texttt{numtaps} passed to \texttt{remez} was 399. The sampling frequency fs was 1024 Hz.\\

\noindent Ideally, the notch filters would attenuate only the additive noise frequencies, while not affecting frequencies. Zooming in on the ECG spectrum showed that
the noise existed almost entirely in the bands 32.5 – 32.7 Hz and 61.6 – 61.8 Hz; these frequencies define the stopband edges. To define the \texttt{bands} parameter, it is
also necessary to choose a transition bandwidth. Reducing the transition bandwidth results in less stop-band attenuation. By experimentation, it was found that a transition
bandwidth of 3.5 Hz eliminated the noise frequencies. The bands parameter was passed as $[0, 29, 32.5, 32.7, 36.2, 58.1, 61.6, 61.8, 65.3, 512]$. The desired gain in each
band of \texttt{bands} is defined by \texttt{desired}, which must be half the length of bands. The value for desired $[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]$.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{remez.png}
    \caption{Function prototype and description for \texttt{remez}.}
    \label{fig:remez}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Frequency Sampled FIR Filter}
ciPy does not define a function to design a frequency-sampled FIR filter, so a Python script was written to do this. The script was adapted from an example found in [2].
The script takes 400 equally spaced samples of the ideal frequency response with one sample taken at 0 Hz (i.e. a type 1 sampling scheme). Two transition samples were used,
though this can easily be changed with the \texttt{num\_transition\_samples} variable. The transition samples are equally spaced in magnitude, though ideal magnitude spacing may be
derived by extending the work in [3]. The inverse discrete Fourier transform of the ideal frequency response is calculated, giving the impulse response, which is then
shifted to make it symmetrical. The symmetrical impulse response is then tapered by a Hamming window.

\subsection{Pole-Zero Placed IIR Filters}
A simple method for IIR filter design is pole-zero placement on the z-plane. Zeros are placed in locations where the desired frequency response is zero. Poles are placed at
the same angle as the poles; their radii determine the transition bandwidth. To keep filter coefficients real, complex poles and zeros must come in complex-conjugate pairs.\\

\noindent For a notch filter, the angles the angle to place zeros (and poles) are:
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{arg}(z) = \pm \ang{360} \frac{f_{\textrm{notch}}}{f_s}
\end{equation}

\noindent With noise frequencies at 32.6 Hz and 61.7 Hz, zeros and poles were placed at ±11.46° for one notch filter and ±21.69° for the other notch filter. The 3 dB bandwidth of the
filters was specified as f3dB = 5 Hz, and the pole radius was calculated with:
\begin{equation}
    r = 1 - \frac{BW}{f_s}\pi
\end{equation}

\noindent Giving $r = 0.9847$ for both filters. To remove both noise frequencies, the IIR filters were cascaded together. Scaling factors of $0.99057$ and $0.98633$ were calculated and applied to
maintain unity passband gain. Figure 3 shows the final filter realisation.

\subsection{Noise Power Estimate}
Noise power was estimated by subtracting the variance of the ECG signals after filtering from the variance of the
ECG signals before filtering. To estimate the relative noise powers, the power at individual interference frequencies
was computed. This was trivial for the IIR filter as it is the cascade of two notch filters. The FIR filters are single
filters with two notches, so the power spectral density of the noisy ECG signal, computed with the SciPy function
\texttt{periodogram}, was first plotted. The relative height of the noise peaks was used to estimate the relative
noise powers; it was identified that 62\% of the noise was at 61.7 Hz and 38\% was at 32.6 Hz. Table 1 summarises 
the noise power estimates.

\section{Discussion}
An FIR filter may exhibit linear phase, which means that the frequency components of the input signal are delayed 
in time by the same constant amount. An IIR filter cannot have linear phase. The window and optimal FIR filters
in this assignment were designed to have linear phase; the frequency-sampled FIR filter was not. Linear phase is
useful in applications where preserving wave shape is important. In ECGs, linear phase filters may be used to remove
baseline wander without distorting clinical information [4].\\

\noindent A disadvantage of FIR filters is that they use more coefficients for similar attenuation characteristics.
Consequently, the input-to-output delay of an FIR filter is larger. This delay is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Delay} = \frac{N-1}{2f_s}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where N is the number of coefficients and fs is the sampling frequency. Figure 10 shows the delays of the window
FIR filter and the cascaded IIR notch filters. The delay of the FIR filter is 194.3 ms, whereas the IIR filter has
near-zero delay. The FIR delay may be untenable in real-time systems where fast processing is required, such as an
embedded system. An IIR filter may be more suitable for such an application if a non-linear phase response is acceptable.\\

\end{figure}

\noindent Of the four filters, the window FIR filter shows the greatest attenuation at the noise frequencies.
The trade-off is that it has the largest transition bandwidth. As a filters transition bandwidth increases,
the attenuation of desired spectral characteristics increases. This is undesirable as it can remove important
information from a signal. The effect of an increased transition bandwidth can be seen by comparing Fig. 5 with
Fig. 8. In the spectrum of Fig. 5, frequencies around the noise frequencies are attenuated. In the spectrum of Fig. 8,
the impulses representing the noise have been removed, with less obvious attenuation on the surrounding frequencies.
If the notch attenuation is too small, then noise will still be present in the spectrum. This is shown in Fig. 7.
Table 2 summaries the transition bandwidths and notch attenuations for the filters.\\

        IIR & 5 & -16 & 5 & -19\\
        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    }
\end{table}

\noindent Experimentation found that a Hamming window gave the best response for the window FIR filter.
In general, the window choice is a trade-off between transition width and stop-band attenuation.
The maximum stopband attenuation is constant for a given window. A Blackman window has a greater
maximum stopband attenuation than a Hamming window, but it was found that using a Hamming window
resulted in more attenuation at the notch frequencies. This is because the Blackman window has a
larger transition bandwidth, so the attenuation it reaches for the same notch bandwidth is less 
than the Hamming window.\\

\noindent Pass-band ripple is another filter property which can undesirably affect the ECG signal
spectrum; this refers to fluctuations in the passband of a filter’s magnitude response. A small amount
of passband ripple can be seen in the filter frequency response of Fig. 6. Because of passband ripple,
frequencies that would ideally be unaffected are instead multiplied by slightly different amounts. This
could cause issues in detecting the R peak voltage of an ECG, which is the maximum amplitude of the QRS
complex ECG component. Figure 10 shows a typical representation of the QRS complex in an ECG. The R amplitude
is important for heart rate measurement and is used when detecting arrhythmia (abnormal heart rate) and other
heart issues [5], [6].\\

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{qrs.png}
    \caption{QRS complex of a typical ECG.}
    \label{fig:qrs}
\end{figure}

The best filter is the cascade of IIR filters. The noise frequencies are not present in the IIR filtered
ECG spectrum. This is also true for the window and optimal FIR filters, but the window filter has a large
transition bandwidth, and the optimal filter has obvious passband ripple. Another advantage of the IIR
filter is that it is far more computationally efficient than the FIR filters. Only 4 memory elements are
needed for the IIR filter, whereas the FIR filters required 399 or 400. The IIR filter is more suitable
for applications with limited resources than the FIR filters. The IIR filter output is faster to compute
because fewer operations are required. The result is less delay in the output of the IIR filter compared
to the FIR filters. The non-linear phase response shown in Fig. 9 must be tolerated with the IIR filter. 

\section{Conclusion}
An ECG signal corrupted by additive noise at 32.6 Hz and 61.7 Hz was filtered by four different notch
filters – three FIR and one IIR. Each FIR filter has two notches at the noise frequencies. They were
designed using the window, optimal, and frequency-sampled methods. Functions from Python’s SciPy
library were used to design the window and optimal filters, and a script was written to implement
the frequency-sampled method. The IIR filter consists of two cascaded IIR notch filters, each with
two zeros and two poles. These were designed analytically with pole-zero placement.\\

\noindent The IIR filter was determined to be the best filter. It was the most computationally efficient.
The noise was not visible in the ECG spectrum after IIR filtering. It also showed less input-to-output
delay than the FIR filters. The disadvantage is that it has a non-linear phase response. The frequency-sampled
FIR filtered ECG signal still had noise present in its spectrum. The window FIR filter has a wide transition
bandwidth at 10 Hz, so frequencies neighbouring the noise were significantly attenuated. The optimal FIR
filter has good attenuation at the noise frequencies and a transition bandwidth equal to the IIR filters
but shows some passband ripple.
